## SCARA+ System: Bin Picking System Of Revolution-Symmetry Objects
Jin, G., Yu, X., Chen, Y., Li, J. (2023), SCARA+ System: Bin Picking System Of Revolution-Symmetry Objects, submitted to IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron.

## Overview
Inspired by the fact that the DoF of the revolution-symmetry pose just matches that of an SCARA with an additional revolute joint, this article explores the possibility of adopting the configuration of an SCARA with an additional revolute joint and 3D camera to achieve the bin picking of lightweight revolution-symmetry objects. This configuration  is referred to as the ``SCARA plus system`` in the article. This repository mainly contains the codes for simulations and experiments in the articles.

## Usage
### Setups
MATLAB R2020a without any dependencies.

### Main Instruction
To run the single-marker calibration, call
```
[Rcf,tcf,pcf,Rit,tit,pit,rnticf,rntiit] = Alg(Ri,ti,ppi)
```
where
* ``Ri`` (3x3xn): the rotation matrix of robot pose (n is the measurement number),
* ``ti`` (3xn): the translation vector of robot pose,
* ``ppi`` (3xnxm): the 3D observation of a marker (m is the marker number),

* ``Rcf`` (3x3): the rotation matrix of the hand-eye parameter of closed-form solution,
* ``tcf`` (3x1): the translation vector of the hand-eye parameter of closed-form solution (unit: mm),
* ``pcf`` (3mx1): the marker position of closed-form solution (unit: mm), 
* ``rnticf`` (1x1):  the runtime of closed-form solution (unit: seconds),
* ``Rit`` (3x3): the rotation matrix of the hand-eye parameter of iterative solution,
* ``tit`` (3x1): the translation vector of the hand-eye parameter of iterative solution (unit: mm),
* ``pit`` (3mx1): the marker position of iterative solution (unit: mm), 
* ``rnticf`` (1x1):  the runtime of closed-form solution of iterative solution (unit: seconds).
